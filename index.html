      <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Good Samaritans of Syria was founded by a small group of students who devised a plan to assist Syrian refugees. We were encouraged to do so after a violent crackdown in Syria caused 14 million Syrians to flee the country. Our mission is to collect funds and donate them to Syrian relief organizations so that Syrians can live in a better environment. Our organization is made up of volunteers who are passionate about making a difference, and if you are unable to participate in our missions, you can still help the cause by donating!

          <p>Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles. Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber. Always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But, you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.</p>
